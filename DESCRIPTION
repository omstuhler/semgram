Description: A framework for extracting semantic motifs around entities in textual data. It implements and entity-centered semantic grammar that distinguishes six classes of motifs: actions of an entity, treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an entity, characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity. Motifs are identified by applying a set of fixed extraction rules to a parsed text object that includes part-of-speech and dependency annotations - such as those generated by 'spacyr'.
