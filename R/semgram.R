#' semgram: R package for extracting semantic motifs from text
#'
#' semgram extracts semantic motifs from textual data. It builds on an entity-centered semantic grammar that distinguishes six classes of motifs: actions of an entity, treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an entity, characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity.
